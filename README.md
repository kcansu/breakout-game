A 2D arcade-style Breakout game created in Unity. Designed to explore simple game mechanics, level generation via ScriptableObjects and basic gameplay systems such as lives and win/lose conditions.

**Core Gameplay** 

* The player starts with 3 lives and controls a paddle to bounce a ball upward.
* Blocks with varying health values are arranged in different patterns each level via a randomized level generator.
* If the ball falls below the paddle, the player loses a life.
* The game ends when all lives are lost.
* The player progresses to the next level when all blocks are destroyed.

**Scoring** 
* Since block types have different score values and are placed randomly each level, the possible high score varies, adding unpredictability and replayability.
